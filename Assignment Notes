I did the two way binding with [(ngModel)]. I displayed the username via string interpolation
with the double curly brace notation in a p tag underneath the input element. I
did it this way because its easier to read the code in the html instead of having to trace it
back to the type script. The problems I ran in to were mixing up that [] is for
attribute binding and () is for event binding. I also mixed up the boolean logic for the
disabled attribute.
